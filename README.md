# PgHaMigrations

PgHaMigrations is a gem that applies learned best practices to ActiveRecord Migrations.

Provided functionality:
- [Migrations](#migrations)
- [Utilities](#utilities)
- [Rake Tasks](#rake-tasks)


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pg_ha_migrations'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pg_ha_migrations

## Usage

### Migrations

In general, existing migrations are prefixed with `unsafe_` and safer alternatives are provided prefixed with `safe_`. 

Migrations prefixed with `unsafe_` will warn when invoked. The API is designed to be explicit yet remain flexible. There may be situations where invoking the unsafe migration is preferred.

Migrations prefixed with `safe_` prefer concurrent operations where available, set low lock timeouts where appropriate, and decompose operations into multiple safe steps.

The following functionality is currently unsupported:

- Rollbacks
- Generators
- schema.rb

#### safe\_create\_table

Safely creates a new table.

```ruby
safe_create_table :table do |t|
  t.type :column
end
```

#### safe\_create\_enum\_type

Safely create a new enum without values.

```ruby
safe_create_enum_type :enum
```
Or, safely create the enum with values.
```ruby
safe_create_enum_type :enum, ["value1", "value2"]
```

#### safe\_add\_enum\_value

Safely add a new enum value.

```ruby
safe_add_enum_value :enum, "value"
```

#### safe\_add\_column

Safely add a column.

```ruby
safe_add_column :table, :column, :type
```

#### unsafe\_add\_column

Unsafely add a column, but do so with a lock that is safely acquired.

```ruby
unsafe_add_column :table, :column, :type
```

#### safe\_change\_column\_default

Safely change the default value for a column.

```ruby
safe_change_column_default :table, :column, "value"
```

#### safe\_make\_column\_nullable

Safely make the column nullable.

```ruby
safe_make_column_nullable :table, :column
```

#### unsafe\_make\_column\_not\_nullable

Unsafely make a column not nullable.

```ruby
unsafe_make_column_not_nullable :table, :column
```

#### safe\_add\_concurrent\_index

Add an index concurrently. Migrations that contain this statement must also include `disable_ddl_transaction!`.

```ruby
safe_add_concurrent_index :table, :column
```

Add a composite btree index.

```ruby
safe_add_concurrent_index :table, [:column1, :column2], name: "index_name", using: :btree
```

#### safe\_remove\_concurrent\_index

Safely remove an index. Migrations that contain this statement must also include `disable_ddl_transaction!`.

```ruby
safe_remove_concurrent_index :table, :name => :index_name
```


### Utilities

#### safely\_acquire\_lock\_for\_table

Safely acquire a lock for a table.

```ruby
safely_acquire_lock_for_table(:table) do
  ...
end
```

#### adjust\_lock\_timeout

Adjust lock timeout.

```ruby
adjust_lock_timeout(seconds) do
  ...
end
```

#### adjust\_statement\_timeout

Adjust statement timeout.

```ruby
adjust_statement_timeout(seconds) do
  ...
end
```

#### safe\_set\_maintenance\_work\_mem\_gb

Set maintenance work mem.

```ruby
safe_set_maintenance_work_mem_gb 1
```


### Rake Tasks

Use this to check for blocking transactions before migrating.

    $ bundle exec rake pg_ha_migrations:check_blocking_database_transactions

This rake task expects that you already have a connection open to your database. We suggest that you add another rake task to open the connection and then add that as a prerequisite for `pg_ha_migrations:check_blocking_database_transactions`.

```ruby
namespace :db do
  desc "Establish a database connection"
  task :establish_connection do
    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
  end
end

Rake::Task["pg_ha_migrations:check_blocking_database_transactions"].enhance ["db:establish_connection"]
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies and start a postgres docker container. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
